# Hardware (GPU) Config

## 1. Confirm GPUs

Here we have good old Windows 7. This guide and the Ravencoin miner we recommend will work with any version of Windows. More guides for other OS's are upcoming.

Make your way to the **Device Manager**:

Control Panel > All Items > System > Device Manager

And confirm that your PC knows that it has a GPU. ðŸ¤¨ The **NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030** listed above is *only one of the two GPUs in this PC*, so something's not 100% correct here. We'll need to install the newest drivers.


## 2. Go to your GPU manufacturer's Driver Download page

These can be awful to navigate but stay strong and use Ctrl+F and dropdown menus to find your exact GPU model and operating system combo.

## 4. Verify Driver Success

Retry driver install competely if it doesn't work first time. Restart your old PC when you get stuck or everything looks upgraded-- this allows Windows to locate the new hardware on startup.
