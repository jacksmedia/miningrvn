# Make Miner Auto-start!

## 1. Make Shortcut for nanominer program

Right click menu has a "Create Shortcut" option that helps us automate Windows a tiny bit. How? 

You'll soon find out! Just make a Shortcut to **nanominer.exe** for now.

## 2. Place Miner Shortcut into 🪄Startup directory🪄

Look up the exact location of the \Startup directory in your copy of Windows. It varies wildly from version to version, so just search online...

- Copy the directory path somewhere (Notepad app, or even an empty browser tab address bar) then make sure you replace the "user name" with your actual Windows User name.

- Copy this new, accurate path. Here's the format for Windows 7:

```code
C:\Users\your-user-name-goes-here\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft \Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
- Press Windows + R (open the Run part of the Start Menu).

- Paste in the path to your \Startup directory, and then Enter opens it up.

- Finally, go back to the \nanominer directory...

- Move the Shortcut from Step 1 into this magic directory 🪄\Startup🪄.
